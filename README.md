# 🛠️ CRUD Backend Project (Go + HTML + JS)

This is my first complete **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** project, built using **Go (Golang)** for the backend and **pure JavaScript with HTML** for the frontend. This project means far more to me than just code — it's a reflection of my persistence, logic, learning, and growth as a developer.

## 🧠 About This Project

Many might call it a "simple CRUD app" — but for me, it’s a major achievement.

This is my first full backend project where I applied my own logic from start to finish.
Although I had previously done some basic CRUD operations by following YouTube tutorials, this time I challenged myself to build everything independently — without watching videos or copying code.

I built this entirely based on my own understanding.
I faced bugs, confusion, and unexpected issues — but every challenge taught me something valuable.
This project isn’t just code to me — it represents growth, learning, and a personal milestone.


What makes this special:
- It's my **first backend project** which built entirely with my own logic — and I wrote it **from scratch**.
- I used **pure JavaScript** for the frontend — no libraries or frameworks.
- I created a **simple static UI**, because I want to start from fundamentals before moving to frameworks like **React**.
- Some modules or edge cases might not be fully handled **yet**, but that’s part of my roadmap for improvement.

## 💡 Things to Note

- The frontend is **served statically** using Go.
- The frontend is written in **pure JavaScript** — no React or frameworks yet (though I plan to migrate to React in future).
- Some edge cases or error handling may not yet be fully implemented — this is a work in progress and will evolve!
- The experience of hitting 400 errors, decoding JSON issues, and solving them all myself was incredibly valuable and helped deepen my understanding of backend logic.

## 🙌 Final Note

This project is **very personal** to me. It represents my transition into backend development and reflects my effort to understand the core concepts by building instead of watching. I’m proud of how far I’ve come — and I’m just getting started!

Thanks for reading ❤️
